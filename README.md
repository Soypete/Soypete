## Projects

### Go Zero to Hero

I believe the simplicity and cleanliness of the Go programming language makes it a suitable language for first-time programmers. However, things like a GoPath, Dependencies, binaries, CLIs, IDEs, and Git make it hard for someone who has never coded before to just pick up Go in their free time, so I started writing this tutorial for people who have less that one year of programming experience or even no experience whatsoever. It is to help them learn Go and master other tools as well.

To explore the course or contribute to the project, you can check out the [Github repo](github.com/Soypete/Golang_tutorial_zero_to_hero).
As a board member of Forge Foundation non-profit, I have been asked to help with the meetups that are run by the Foundation. I love meetups and the wonderful opportunities they give attendees to learn, network, recruit, and grow in there careers. A comprehesive list of the meetups can be found on our meetup pro page [here](https://www.meetup.com/pro/forge-utah).

Anyone is welcome to request topics, or even just to come and hang out. If you are interested in learning more please join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/forgeutah/shared_invite/zt-pietaeqb-HetfD2OIzn1RHtDtV~CH5g) or [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/forge-utah).

### Production Go

This [repo](https://github.com/Soypete/Production-Go-Examples) was developed as a series of exercises for the _Production Go Pattern and Anti-patterns for Memory Management_ workshop. It can be completed independently if needed. It was last updated March 2023

### Go Web Services in 3 Weeks

This [repo](https://github.com/Soypete/WebServices-in-3-weeks) is the set of exercises for the _Go Web Development in 3 Weeks_ workshop. It is still work in progress with a planned completion before July 2023

### Go 20 questions API game
