Hey there ðŸ‘‹,
I am [Miriah Peterson](https://miriahpeterson.com), a Data Engineer, Meetup organizer, Twitch Coder, and Speaker. I work mostly in Golang, but I'm also interested in Python, Rust, and other backend/low level languages. I'm a big fan of open source, and I'm always interested in learning new things. I love to share what I learn, and I'm always open to suggestions and feedback. You can see new technologies I learn on my twitch stream [here](https://twitch.tv/soypete01).

I have two dogs, Max ![max](img/maximus.png | width=100) and Lou Lou ![lou](img/louloubig.png | width=100).

### Go From Zero to Hero

I believe the simplicity and cleanliness of the Go programming language makes it a suitable language for first-time programmers. However, things like a GoPath, Dependencies, binaries, CLIs, IDEs, and Git make it hard for someone who has never coded before to just pick up Go in their free time, so I started writing this tutorial for people who have less that one year of programming experience or even no experience whatsoever. It is to help them learn Go and master other tools as well.

To explore the course or contribute to the project, you can check out the [Github repo](github.com/Soypete/Golang_tutorial_zero_to_hero).
